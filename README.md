# Mustache.clojure

Mustache.clojure is a simple clojure interface to [Mustache.java](https://github.com/spullara/mustache.java). 

Mustache.java is a high performance implementation of Mustache for the JVM. However due to some [implemention issues](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mustachejava/e8EjcdYUY3E), Mustache.java does not interact well with Clojure data structures.

Mustache.clojure works around those issues. It supports the following features.

* Clojure data structures
* Keywords as map keys
* Translating dashes in keyword keys to underscores
* Clojure functions in data
* Clojure seqs

## Requirements

Mustache.clojure depends on Mustache.java, which requires Java 1.8.

## Usage

Include mustache.clojure in your leinigen project.

    [mustache.clojure "0.3.0"]

Create a mustache factory, and use that to create functions that wrap your mustache templates. e.g.

    (use 'mustache.core)
    (def factory (mustache-factory))
    (def template-function (mustache-compile mustache-factory "some-resource"))
    (def data {:foo [1 2 3 5 8 13] 
               :bar (range 0 10)} 
               :render-time #(str (java.util.Date.))})
    (template-function data)

The no-arg version of `mustache-factory` creates a factory that will load templates as resources from the root of the classpath. You may also pass in a string which indicates which directory to use as resource root e.g. `(mustache-factory "resources/mustache")`. Additionally, you may pass in a `java.io.File` object or `java.nio.file.Path` object to indicate a directory to serve as a root for loading templates from the file system.

Mustache.java handles reloading by discarding the mustache factory and creating a new one. To accommodate this, `mustache-compile` can accept an `atom` containing a mustache factory rather than a direct refererence to a mustache factory, and you can reset the atom reference as appropriate to facilitate reloading.

## Tests

Mustache.clojure passes all of the mustache spec tests with some differences in whitespace, as per Mustache.java. To see which tests produce different behaviors, search the spec's yml files for the key `whitespace_diff`.
